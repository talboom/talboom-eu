introduction: "Moving from WhatsApp to Signal seems simple, but in practice it can be a hassle. Why move if no one in your network uses Signal? And why use Signal if no one moves? This is a problem we need to solve together.\n\n To tackle this issue, I have developed a tool that lets you add an \"Also on Signal\"-badge to your profile picture. This badge shows that you're also on Signal, making it easier for your friends and family to find you on Signal."

## The network effect problem

There is a growing concern about the influence and power of Big Tech, leading to increasing attention on alternatives. One example of this is the discussion around WhatsApp versus Signal.

The reasons to move away from WhatsApp and toward Signal are well-documented: better privacy, end-to-end encryption by default, no data mining for advertising, open-source code that can be audited. The real challenge isn't convincing people that Signal is better. The real challenge is making the majority actually switch.

This is the classic network effect problem. Moving to better social technology isn't just an individual choice, it requires your network.

## What are the challenges we face?

I think there is currently the assumption that the solution lies within individual motivation, however this is a much too narrow view. I believe focusing on this alone will not lead to successful adoption.

**To explain the challenges I see**, here's what I observe:

1. People install Signal
2. They find that most of their network isn't there
3. They keep WhatsApp as their primary messenger because that's where the conversations are
4. Signal becomes a secondary app that rarely gets opened

What is happening is a visibility problem. People don't know who in their network is also on Signal unless they explicitly check or ask.

**So how to solve this?** To address this visibility problem, I've built a simple tool: an "Also on Signal" badge for your profile picture. It adds a small, visible indicator to your WhatsApp profile picture that signals you're also reachable on Signal. This doesn't solve everything, but it creates a feedback loop:

- People see the badge and realize you're on Signal
- They're more likely to reach out to you there
- As more people add the badge, the network effect starts working in Signal's favor instead of against it
- The tipping point might become achievable

## The responsibility we share

To be clear, I don't want to present this as a silver bullet, but rather as one step toward understanding the problem and determining what we (as a collective) can do to make progress. Moving to better technology is a collective responsibility. We need to create the conditions that make it possible.

So, if you're already on Signal, consider adding the badge. If you're not yet on Signal but you've been thinking about it, this might be the moment. Tou can find the tool at [Signalbadge.eu](https://signalbadge.eu). It is open source and respects your privacy—images are processed locally in your browser.

Small actions that increase visibility can create conditions for larger shifts. Hopefully this tools helps a little.
