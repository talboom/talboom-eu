            Ten years ago, I joined Picnic Technologies, which has since
            revolutionized the online grocery landscape in the Netherlands,
            Germany and France. I was part of the company's growth from ten to
            20.000 employees and have been in various leadership roles. In my
            most recent role, I led a domain of 150 software engineers across
            14 teams, demonstrating my ability to manage large,
            cross-functional teams and deliver on complex projects. My
            analytical mindset and strong conceptual thinking have
            continuously enabled me to be successful in key leadership
            roles. I recently relocated to Stockholm and am excited for my
            next step.

            Throughout my career, I've been passionate about building scalable
            software systems and leading engineering teams. From personally
            delivering the first customer order at Picnic to scaling warehouse
            management systems that process millions of orders, I've experienced
            the full spectrum of technology leadership.
